I develop a few R packages that rely on JavaScript libraries:

-   [altdoc](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com): use
    [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/),
    [docute](https://docute.org/), or [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
    to build a website for your R package documentation (alternative to
    `{pkgdown}`).

-   [conductor](https://github.com/etiennebacher/conductor) (*adaptation
    of [shepherd.js](https://shepherdjs.dev/)*): create tours in Shiny
    apps.

-   [shinyfullscreen](https://github.com/etiennebacher/shinyfullscreen)
    (*adaptation of
    [screenfull.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js)*):
    display HTML elements in fullscreen in Shiny apps.

-   [prompter](https://github.com/etiennebacher/prompter) (*adaptation
    of [hint.css](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css)*): easily
    create tooltips in Shiny apps.

While developing these packages, I had some trouble trying to determine
if a Javascript library had already been adapted in R. Therefore, I
started a list of R packages that adapt Javascript libraries, and you
are invited to contribute:
[awesome-R-JS-adaptation](https://github.com/etiennebacher/awesome-R-JS-adaptation).

I also contribute to some R packages from the
[**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/) organization (mostly
[datawizard](https://github.com/easystats/datawizard)).
