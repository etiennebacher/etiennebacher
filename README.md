I am developing a few R packages, which are mostly derived from existing
JavaScript libraries (:heavy\_check\_mark: for the packages on CRAN, and
:heavy\_multiplication\_x: for the others):

-   :heavy\_multiplication\_x:
    [altdoc](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com): use [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/) or [docute](https://docute.org/) to build a webpage for your R package
    documentation (alternative to `{pkgdown}`).

-   :heavy\_check\_mark:
    [shinyfullscreen](https://github.com/etiennebacher/shinyfullscreen)
    (*adaptation of
    [screenfull.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js)*):
    display HTML elements in fullscreen in Shiny apps.

-   :heavy\_check\_mark:
    [prompter](https://github.com/etiennebacher/prompter) (*adaptation
    of [hint.css](https://github.com/chinchang/hint.css)*): easily
    create tooltips in Shiny apps.

-   :heavy\_check\_mark:
    [circletyper](https://github.com/etiennebacher/circletyper)
    (*adaptation of
    [CircleType.js](https://github.com/peterhry/CircleType)*): curve
    text elements in Shiny apps.

-   :heavy\_check\_mark:
    [spoiler](https://github.com/etiennebacher/spoiler) (*adaptation of
    [spoiler-alert.js](https://github.com/joshbuddy/spoiler-alert)*):
    blur some elements in Shiny apps.

While developing these packages, I had some trouble trying to determine
if a Javascript library had already been adapted in R. Therefore, I just
started a list of R packages that adapt Javascript libraries, and you
are invited to contribute! [Hereâ€™s the
list](https://github.com/etiennebacher/r-js-adaptation).
